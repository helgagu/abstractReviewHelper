<h1>Project Abstract Review Helper</h1>

A web application to help researchers perform abstract reviews

<h2>Background - why?</h2>

Currently, I am a PhD student in Industrial Engineering at the University of Iceland. The objective of my PhD project is to create a systemic view of knowledge worker productivity. I will not go into detail here except to tell you why I am building this software. To create a systemic view using system dynamics I need to gather elements and possible relations to draw up a causal loop diagram to start with. This means that I am trying to read through 2166 abstracts and extract keywords their contexts and group them together.

With this software I am hoping to remove some of the manual headache of typing up keywords, contexts and groups into excel and the endless copy-paste which that entails. In short, I want to upload references with abstracts, go through each abstract one by one, mark them as excluded if they are not relevant and extract keywords with context in those that are relevant. Then I want to go over the list of keywords and group them into e.g. themes, categories, groups and concepts (depends on the detail I want to go into). Then I want to export statistics about e.g. how many references fall into each group, how many are included/excluded etc. I also want to export references to load into endnote e.g. only included references or references in a specific group so that I can work further with them to maybe do a paper review or use as references in papers. You get the gist.

The second objective with this software is to learn to use new technology. I have mostly worked with Java and now I want to learn among other things C# and ReactJS. I am therefore going to build a web application (even though I will most likely only use it locally on my computer). The plan is to use SQL express server, C#, ASP.NET MVC and ReactJS. Lets see if that will change!

<h2>Project Management</h2>

Even though I am working on this project alone, I am a big fan of agile. I have created a Trello board which can be seen here if anyone is interested in how this project is progressing: https://trello.com/b/IOCuK4Le/abstract-review-helper

I have decided though not to restrict myself to a sprint, since I do not know how much time I can allocate to this project weekly but I am going to decide which stories will belong to the version I am working on and make each version a "shippable product".
